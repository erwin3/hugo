{"name":"HuGO","tagline":"Human Group Onsight - a tool to visualize family constellations","body":"### Welcome to the HuGO project.\r\nFamily Constellations (a subset application of Systemic Constellations) is an experiential process that aims to release and resolve profound tensions within and between people. Bert Hellinger, a German philosopher-psychologist is considered the founder of Family Constellations in their modern form.\r\nLook at [Wikipedia: Family Constellations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Constellations) for more informations. \r\n\r\n[Christian Borck](http://www.cborck.de/) is a german therapist, who uses this method for several years now.\r\nThe Idea of this project came at such a family constellation meeting.\r\nThe goal is to have a tool to visualize family constellations based on Html5, CSS3, Javascript and maybe PHP5.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nHuGO is published under [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html).\r\n\r\n### Local Usage\r\nYou can download the tarball or zipfile above, unpack it and open the file src/hugo.html \r\nwith your local browser.\r\n\r\n### Usage on your homepage\r\nSince HuGO is developed under GPLv3 you are free to use, change or redistribute it under the terms of this license.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nHuGO is developed by \r\nChristian Seeger - concept, development\r\nHenning MÃ¤lzer (@erwin3) - concept, development\r\nChristian Borck - idea, reference user\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n[HuGO project](http://erwin3.github.io/hugo/) -\r\n[HuGO Development](https://github.com/erwin3/hugo) -\r\n[newest alpha](http://erwin3.github.io/hugo/alpha/hugo.html)","google":"HuGO Human Group Onsight Familien aufstellung Familienaufstellung","note":"Don't delete this file!
